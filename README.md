<h1> SpellChecker </h1>
<p> 
This is the first version of a spell checker program that checks for spelling errors in an inputed sentence using Python.
This is just a random program I wrote to apply some of the concepts that I have learned in Python. A more sophisticated version of the program
would be designed and uploaded. 
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p> Run check.py in the command prompt and the console would prompt you for a sentence
    Type in any sentence and the program would return a dictionary that maps the word to a True or False Boolean value.
